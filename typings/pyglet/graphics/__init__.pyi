class Batch:
    """Manage a collection of drawables for batched rendering.

    Many drawable pyglet objects accept an optional `Batch` argument in their
    constructors. By giving a `Batch` to multiple objects, you can tell pyglet
    that you expect to draw all of these objects at once, so it can optimise its
    use of OpenGL. Hence, drawing a `Batch` is often much faster than drawing
    each contained drawable separately.

    The following example creates a batch, adds two sprites to the batch, and
    then draws the entire batch::

        batch = pyglet.graphics.Batch()
        car = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(car_image, batch=batch)
        boat = pyglet.sprite.Sprite(boat_image, batch=batch)

        def on_draw():
            batch.draw()

    While any drawables can be added to a `Batch`, only those with the same
    draw mode, shader program, and group can be optimised together.

    Internally, a `Batch` manages a set of VertexDomains along with
    information about how the domains are to be drawn. To implement batching on
    a custom drawable, get your vertex domains from the given batch instead of
    setting them up yourself.
